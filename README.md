Upon accessing the website, the user is directed to the Home page. The home page provides the user with information about CarPoGo and its unique features that sets it aside from other ride sharing platforms. It also provides the user with an overview on how to utilise the web based application. From the home page, the user can access a contact us page. This page is designed to allow the users to provide feedback and any queries they may have. 

Home Page:
From the home page, the user can sign up if they do not have an account. They can also log into the web based application. Upon signing up the user is prompted to top up immediately. This is done since CarPoGo prides itself on being a cashless system. The user has an account with credits which they can top up or withdraw. It is important to note that a withdrawal fee is charged. This is to encourage drivers to also be riders and fully utilise the capabilities of the application. 

Sign Up:
A successful sign up will lead the user to their profile page where they will be prompted to fill out their personal details. Submitting the details directs the user to the Dashboard. The Dashboard provides the user with useful insights that are easily accessible. These include an overview of their balance with the option to either top up or withdraw. The user has an overview of their recent notifications. The dashboard also has an interactive map with the locations of all of the hubs. When the user hovers over the pin they can view the name of the hub, and by clicking on the pin they can view a short description of the hub. 

The Navigation Bar:
The navigation bar contains a link to the user profile for the user to edit their details if need be. The navigation bar also contains a link to the user’s notification page. Through this page the user can view their incoming requests and other notifications. 

The Our Hubs page, that can be accessed through the navigation bar contains detailed information on the hubs and their exact locations. CarPoGo prides itself on the hub system, as it ensures the user is picked up and dropped off at a safe location. The hubs are carefully chosen and are located in very central locations. 

The navigation bar is interactive and only previews links dependent on the user’s current state. The user has the option to either use the application as a driver, or as a passenger. Initially the user is viewed as a passenger, where all the passenger pages are available. The user can only act as a driver and view all the relevant driver pages upon completing their driver details. 

Being a Driver:
The driver has the option to either view existing passenger rides awaiting a driver, or they can schedule their own ride for the passengers to view and ask to join. The leaving now link allows the driver to schedule an immediate ride which the passengers can request to join. 

If the driver has scheduled a ride, they can view all their scheduled rides through the link, your rides awaiting passenger requests. The driver will be notified though their notifications once a passenger has joined the scheduled ride. Once a driver and passenger pair has occurred, the driver can view all of their future rides, through the relevant navigation bar link. The driver will also be able to view personal information about the passenger. Through this page the driver will commence the ride. The driver is also able to view all of their past rides.

Being a Passenger:
The passenger has all of the same functionalities as the driver, except they cannot see their rides in progress, as the driver is the one in control of the start and end of the ride. 

Party:
Passengers have the ability to form a party where they can take a ride together and enjoy the benefit of paying a discounted rate. A party is encouraged as more seats will then be filled. 

Balance and Transactions:
The user can view their current balance and top up through the link on the navigation bar. The user can also view all of their past transactions.
